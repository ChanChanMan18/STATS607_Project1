# On the cross-validation bias due to unsupervised preprocessing - Main Code Example

## Description

In this project, we reproduce the results of the paper *On the cross-validation bias due to unsupervised preprocessing* by Moscovich and Rosset, 2002. In particular, the main example is reproduced, which serves to rebut a claim made in the classic textbook *The Elements of Statistical Learning* by Hastie et al., 2009.
